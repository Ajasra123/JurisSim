DEFENDANT'S ANTICIPATED DEFENSES:

DMS is expected to argue:
1. Performance metrics were affected by broader market conditions and COVID-19 impact
2. TechCorp failed to provide necessary cooperation and timely feedback
3. Contract terms were recommendations, not guarantees
4. TechCorp's own product quality issues contributed to poor conversion rates
5. Force majeure clauses excuse performance during pandemic period

LEGAL ISSUES:

1. Whether DMS materially breached the service agreement
2. Whether performance guarantees were binding contractual obligations or mere projections
3. Whether TechCorp's damages are proximately caused by DMS's alleged breach
4. Whether force majeure or other defenses excuse DMS's performance
5. Appropriate measure of damages for breach of marketing services contract

RELEVANT CONTRACT PROVISIONS:

Performance Standards Clause: "DMS guarantees to achieve minimum performance metrics as specified in Exhibit A, including but not limited to traffic increases and lead generation improvements."

Force Majeure Clause: "Neither party shall be liable for delays or failures in performance resulting from acts of God, war, terrorism, pandemic, or other circumstances beyond the reasonable control of such party."

Termination Clause: "This agreement may be terminated by either party upon sixty (60) days written notice. In the event of material breach, the non-breaching party may terminate immediately upon written notice."

PROCEDURAL HISTORY:

- Formal notice of breach: September 15, 2023
- Contract terminated by TechCorp: October 1, 2023
- Complaint filed: November 15, 2023

This case presents typical issues in service contract disputes including performance measurement, causation of damages, and the impact of external market conditions on contractual obligations.
